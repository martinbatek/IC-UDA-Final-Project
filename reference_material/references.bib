abstract = {Wildfire is one of the most critical natural disasters that threaten wildlands and forest resources. Traditional firefighting systems, which are based on ground crew inspection, have several limits and can expose firefighters’ lives to danger. Thus, remote sensing technologies have become one of the most demanded strategies to fight against wildfires, especially UAV-based remote sensing technologies. They have been adopted to detect forest fires at their early stages, before becoming uncontrollable. Autonomous wildfire early detection from UAV-based visual data using different deep learning algorithms has attracted significant interest in the last few years. To this end, in this paper, we focused on wildfires detection at their early stages in forest and wildland areas, using deep learning-based computer vision algorithms to prevent and then reduce disastrous losses in terms of human lives and forest resources.}

ABSTRACT = {This study explores the potential of RGB image data for forest fire detection using deep learning models, evaluating their advantages and limitations, and discussing potential integration within a multi-modal data context. The research introduces a uniquely comprehensive wildfire dataset, capturing a broad array of environmental conditions, forest types, geographical regions, and confounding elements, aiming to reduce high false alarm rates in fire detection systems. To ensure integrity, only public domain images were included, and a detailed description of the dataset&rsquo;s attributes, URL sources, and image resolutions is provided. The study also introduces a novel multi-task learning approach, integrating multi-class confounding elements within the framework. A pioneering strategy in the field of forest fire detection, this method aims to enhance the model&rsquo;s discriminatory ability and decrease false positives. When tested against the wildfire dataset, the multi-task learning approach demonstrated significantly superior performance in key metrics and lower false alarm rates compared to traditional binary classification methods. This emphasizes the effectiveness of the proposed methodology and the potential to address confounding elements. Recognizing the need for practical solutions, the study stresses the importance of future work to increase the representativeness of training and testing datasets. The evolving and publicly available wildfire dataset is anticipated to inspire innovative solutions, marking a substantial contribution to the field.},
